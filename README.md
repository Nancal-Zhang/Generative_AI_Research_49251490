- **File Naming Conventions**:  
  Use descriptive names with underscores instead of spaces (e.g., `Survey_Data_2025.xlsx`, `Interview_Transcript_P01.txt`).

- **Commit Messages**:  
  Write meaningful commit messages that describe your changes (e.g., `Added cleaned survey data` or `Updated interview transcript P02`).

- **Branching and Collaboration**:  
  - Developers should create a new branch for each task/feature.  
  - Pull requests should be reviewed before merging into the main branch.  
  - Resolve merge conflicts carefully, documenting the resolution if necessary.
